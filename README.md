# 2025 Coding Journal

This repository documents my structured 3-month journey (Aug–Nov 2025) to strengthen Java programming, DSA, Git, and backend development — with a focus on internship readiness.  
Each week, I'll share learning notes, mini-projects, solved problems, and progress updates.

## Goals:

- Improve Java fundamentals & object-oriented design
- Practice daily DSA problems (LeetCode, GFG)
- Build and document mini backend projects
- Learn Git & GitHub best practices
- Stay consistent & post weekly progress on LinkedIn

## Weekly Plan :
